In early 2017, one of my customers struck up a conversation with me about Bitcoin, which prompted me to take a second look. After doing much more research this time around, I fell down the rabbit hole and have been a fan ever since.","author":"marshallmixing","github":null,"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonjamesmarshall/"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"45a3d1af-3357-54b8-8d8c-2aae6b0331c6","excerpt":"From the top: These views are my own and do not reflect any official opinions or statements from BlockFi.

I am so thankful for the trust that BlockFi leadership have placed in me during my time with the company to represent the brand on social.</p>\n<p>While we have done some amazing things on Twitter and Instagram, our Reddit community was where I was really able to shine. Since I started, I have grown our Subreddit from 3,000 subscribers to over 23,000 subscribers.</p>\n<p>One of the unique things about Reddit is that I am not posting as BlockFi, I am posting as myself. It’s given me a unique and valuable opportunity to grow trust within our community in a way that is hard to replicate elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Our community doesn’t owe me anything, and yet to see praise like this, from people who currently have their funds locked up in a platform they are unable to withdraw from, is an incredibly validating demonstration of the trust I have helped build during my time with BlockFi. A strong community is such an important asset.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; margin: 0 0 30px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/1098ba8c4766e9cbbaf363f888a262a6/295bd/reddit-feedback.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 106.75675675675676%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Some of the replies on my last BlockFi post\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/1098ba8c4766e9cbbaf363f888a262a6/fcda8/reddit-feedback.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/1098ba8c4766e9cbbaf363f888a262a6/12f09/reddit-feedback.png 148w,\n/static/1098ba8c4766e9cbbaf363f888a262a6/e4a3f/reddit-feedback.png 295w,\n/static/1098ba8c4766e9cbbaf363f888a262a6/fcda8/reddit-feedback.png 590w,\n/static/1098ba8c4766e9cbbaf363f888a262a6/295bd/reddit-feedback.png 667w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>All this to say, it looks like my time with BlockFi is nearing a close.</p>\n<p>While I find myself turning on the “Open To Work” sign on LinkedIn, I don’t find myself leaving crypto.
